# Runbook — rollup refresh + query-frequency observability

Ticket 6 of `docs/wayfinder/2026-09-06-pre-aggregation.md` · Design: `docs/adr/0022-pre-aggregation-sm8-native.md`

## What exists after this ticket

| Piece | Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sm8 rollup-refresh <model>` | adapter (CLI) | one command rebuilds a model's rollups |
| `RollupRefreshService/refresh` | adapter (platform) | server-side trigger surface (Restate SERVICE+SHARED) |
| `RollupRefresher.refreshModel` | adapter (spark-connector) | eager re-materialization of every declared rollup |
| `RollupMaterializer.persistCatalog` | adapter (spark-connector) | durable `saveAsTable` write (job runs before return) |
| `query-frequency-observer` plugin | plugin | counts query shapes per model (PostExecute observer) |
| `QueryShapeCounters.snapshot()` | plugin | programmatic counts read (hottest shapes first) |

## One-command refresh

```bash
sm8 rollup-refresh flights
```

Behavior:
- POSTs `{"model":"flights"}` to `RollupRefreshService/refresh`.
- The server resolves the model's `rollups:` declarations and eagerly rebuilds each one (`saveAsTable`, overwrite mode — the aggregation job RUNS; a returned result means the table is durable).
- Prints one line per rollup: `refreshed -> <table>` or `FAILED: <reason>`; exit 0 only if every rollup refreshed. Per-rollup isolation: one failure never blocks the others.

### Cron wiring

Refresh cadence should match the base table's ingest cadence. Example, nightly 02:30, with staleness alerts:

```cron
# m h dom mon dow  command
30 2 * * * $HOME/bin/sm8 rollup-refresh flights >> $HOME/logs/rollup-refresh.log 2>&1
```

Operational notes:
- `rollup-refresh` is **idempotent**: re-running overwrites the same `<model>__<rollup>` table. A failed run leaves the previous table intact for rollups that did not start or failed before write; rollups are rebuilt independently.
- Refreshes are **not transactional across rollups** — a model with several rollups can end a run half-refreshed (each table individually consistent). If cross-rollup consistency matters, refresh all rollups *before* any consumer is pointed at them, or order consumers after the cron window.
- The write is a full re-aggregation of the base table (no incremental/watermark support in v1). For very large bases, schedule inside the warehouse's quiet window.
- The command targets the server's configured Spark session; the CLI only needs network access to the server.

## Query-frequency observability

Two complementary surfaces feed rollup-selection decisions:

1. **Per-invocation event stream** (Ticket 2): logger `io.sm8.platform.query.QueryShape` at DEBUG — one line per query with the normalized shape. Enable selectively:

```bash
# logback example
<logger name="io.sm8.platform.query.QueryShape" level="DEBUG"/>
```

2. **Aggregate counts** (this ticket): the `query-frequency-observer` plugin keeps JVM-global counters keyed by canonical shape (`model|v<version>|m=measures|d=dimensions`, sorted + deduped so set-equal shapes collide). Read them:

```bash
sm8 inspect io.sm8.plugins.queryfreqobs:counts
```

Each query's post-execute state carries the hottest-first snapshot under that key; the observer also publishes it into `context.meta` for the meta-inspector transport.

### Reading the counts for rollup selection

- Hottest shapes at the top — check whether a declared rollup's (dims, measures) covers any hot shape's group set (`dims ⊆`) and aggregates (Additive set materializes in v1).
- Shapes that never appear do not justify a rollup — drop or don't declare it.
- Cardinality guard: beyond 10,000 distinct shapes, new shapes count under `__overflow__` (telemetry degrades gracefully, never leaks).

## Known limits (v1)

- Time-grain rollups (`time_grain:`) are declared but NOT materializable/routable yet — grain bucketing needs a value-domain contract (Ticket 4/5 review carry-item). Declare grain-less rollups.
- Algebraic measures (Avg/Stddev/Variance) are refused by both the materializer and the router until partial-state columns land; when they do, prefer Welford-merge columns (n, mean, M2) over raw (n, sum, sumSq) for large-mean variance data (catastrophic cancellation).
- The refresh surface is session-catalog scoped in tests; point `saveAsTable` at your production catalog via the server's Spark session configuration.
